               <div class="textContainer">
                    <p> <b>Happiness</b> is a mental or emotional state of well-being defined by positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy. Happy mental states may also reflect judgements by a person about their overall well-being. A variety of biological, psychological, economic, religious and philosophical approaches have striven to define happiness and identify its sources. Various research groups, including positive psychology and happiness economics are employing the scientific method to research questions about what "happiness" is, and how it might be attained. <br> &copy; Wikipedia</p>
                    <p>The search for happiness is a human endeavor – a universal goal. We all want to be happy, and we empathize with each other’s need for it. We search for it with all our might, our thoughts and actions focused on only one goal in life – to be happy.</p>
                    <p>Happiness means different things to different people. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In her book, “The How of Happiness”, Sonja Lyubomirsky, a professor of psychology at the University of California, defines happiness as, “the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one’s life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.”</li>
                        <li>The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines happiness as: A state of well-being and contentment A pleasurable or satisfying experience</li>
                        <li>Author Ayn Rand says: “Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one’s values“.</li>
                        <li>Mahatma Gandhi says: “Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony”.</li>
                        <li>To psychological researchers, the two components of Subjective Well-Being (SWB) are "feelings of happiness" and "thoughts of satisfaction with life".</li>

            <h1 class="page-title">What Makes Humans Happy?</h1>
                <div class="textContainer">
                    <p>Psychologist Martin Seligman and the findings from Positive Psychology studies asserts that humans are happiest when they have the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pleasure (delicious food, a warm bed, anything that pleases one of the 5 senses)</li>
                        <li>Engagement or Flow (the experience of an enjoyable and challenging activity)</li>
                        <li>Relationships (social ties are an extremely reliable factor of happiness) </li>
                        <li>Meaning (belonging to something bigger than ourselves) </li>
                        <li>Accomplishment (the achievement of goals)</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            <h1 class="page-title">Are you Happy?</h1>
                <div class="textContainer">
                    <p>Psychologists have long distinguished the difference of Life Satisfaction (your thoughts and feelings about your life as a whole) from Subjective Well-Being (your actual feelings of happiness at the moment.) One does not decide the outcome of the other.</p>
                    <p>If you were asked to rate your happiness right now, it will not be an accurate indicator of your Life Satisfaction. You may be feeling discontented with your work, or having a fight with your loved one – and you will give your state of happiness a low rating. Subjective Well-Being is dependent on current situations.</p>
                    <p>Maybe you just had a promotion or bought a new car and you’re feeling on top of the world. You’re happy. But if you were asked if you’re satisfied with your life in general, you may rate your Life Satisfaction differently. You probably have more plans for your life that have not come to pass.</p>
                    <p>This shows that happiness is not equal to Life Satisfaction or feelings of fulfillment, which equates to long-term happiness. Your overall sense of well-being cannot be determined by how happy you are today or last Friday.</p>

                    <h1 class="page-title">Make a difference for others!</h1>
            <div class="textContainer">
                    <p>The studies suggest that to achieve long-term happiness, you need to see yourself as a person who is making a difference in this life, and improving the well-being of others. Someone who matters. If you focus on these areas, you will have a greater chance of achieving the state of happiness that every human being long for. What about you? What gives you happiness? </p>
