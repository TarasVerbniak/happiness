                <h3>Happiness Rule 1</h3>
                <p>Often people attempt to live their lives backwards; they try to have more things, or more money, in order to do more of what they want, so they will be happier.  The way it actually works is the reverse.  You must first be who you really are, then do what you need to do, in order to have what you want. <br> &copy; Margaret Young</p>

                <h3>Happiness Rule 2</h3>
                <p>The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature. <br> &copy; Marcus Aurelius</p>

                <h3>Happiness Rule 3</h3>
                <p>Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed.  Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace and gratitude. <br> &copy; Denis Waitley</p>
